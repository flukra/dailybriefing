Structural diversity and biological significance of lipoteichoic acid in Gram-positive bacteria: 
focusing on beneficial probiotic lactic acid bacteria


TA: Teichoic acid (2 types)

-zwitterionic polymers* 
-play very important roles in bacterial physiology

e.g., preservation of divalent cations, including Mg2+, for growth 
maintenance of proton gradient across the cell membrane for energy metabolism,
protection against cationic antimicrobial peptides via three-component peptide-sensing systems

-specific polymers on Gram-Positive bacterial cell surfaces;
word originated from greek teikos, meaning wall)
-consists 50% of the dry cell wall weight


WTA: wall-teichoic acid, backbones differs from bacterial species and strains

-protecting peptidoglycan from bacteriolysis by lysozyme 
-in the control of lytic enzyme localization during cell division

LTA: lipoteichoic acid, most backbones are consisted of poly-GroP (poly-glycerol phosphate)

progression of normal cell division  
receptors for bacteriophages

structural variation WTA > LTA

*polarity

hydrophilic (WTA)
vs
amiphilic (LTA)s 
comprising hydrophilic poly-GroP and a hydrophobic glycolipid anchor. 
free hydroxyl groups in GroP and RboP repeating units: often substituted by d-alanine
